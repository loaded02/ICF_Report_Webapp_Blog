title: Project Is Up And Running!
---

The raw skeleton Project is up and running at heroku. Login, Settings and Profile pages are working.


The code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/loaded02/ICF_Report_Webapp). I want the code to be open. And if you want to contribute, please feel free to do so.
