title: Thanks To GitHub Pages For Hosting Frontend!
---

The Frontend moved from Heroku to GitHub Pages. The site responds now very quickly. 


At the time the site is deployed via a free Heroku account. It is free, but the server goes to sleep after 30 minutes of no traffic. The site took a while to respond in this setup. Now I moved the frontend to GitHub Pages which serve only static content, but respond immediatly. Heroku is used for all calculations. Once you enter the main page, the server has time to wake up and the user doesnt feel strange.
Thanks to those Services!
