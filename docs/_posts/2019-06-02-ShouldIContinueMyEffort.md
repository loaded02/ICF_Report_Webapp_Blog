title: Should I Continue My Effort?
---

All beginnings are difficult. Last year I tried to find some users among physiotherapists, who would like to test the app and give some feedback, while I would be developing. Well, I got feedback ;) Unfortunatly it was a bit devastating. I was even threatened to be sued! (No reason for that - I am still in beta!)

If you like to read for yourself, click [here](https://www.physio.de/forum5/abrechnung/icf-reporting-app-open-source-projekt-feedback/8/149810/149810) (it is in german only). Please feel free to write in the forum and continue the discussion.

I made changes to my app and included the feedback. For example Germans don't like to save personal data on any server. Well, ask Mister Zuckerberg or Payback if that's true. I would have my doubts. Anyways, my app can now only save not personal data like ICF codes. These codes have to be administered by the community. All personal data like patients and therapists can be up- and downloaded directly into the report-form. But these very critical users I found didn't respond anymore. Other users also tested the app, but unfortunatly only the negative feedback was posted into the forum.

After a year I am still thinking to continue my work with this app, because I like the idea of creating a therapy report in the ICF format. I like the idea of having a decent open source tool. And the report form has helped me already a lot. So we will see what the future brings.
