title: Moving to the Cloud
---

I continue my effort to make this app more and more professional and usable.
I had some users who showed serious interest!! Thanks for that! After that, the database got populated. 
Unfortunately I was still on a free account at Heroku and accidentally lost
all of the data. That is why I decided to move to a paid cloud account.
I am looking forward to users who will try the app now :)
