title: Breaking Changes
---

The App has been restructured. Now no personal data of patients or therapists is saved on the server. The server saves only ICF Codes and compilation of Codes, aka ICF Core Sets. These can be filled with personal data and can be downloaded to a local computer.

These changes were necessary due to feedback I received from users. Thanks for the feedback!
